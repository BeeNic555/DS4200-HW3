        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>
            Hi! My name is Fenghao Cui, and I am a second-year student at Northeastern University, 
            majoring in Data Science combined with Business Administration. I have a deep passion 
            for technology, analytics, and problem-solving, which drive my academic and personal 
            pursuits. I am thrilled to have you visit my website, where I share more about my hobbies, 
            interests, and the reasons behind my passion for badminton. You can also find my contact 
            information here. If you have any questions, ideas, or simply want to connect, please 
            don’t hesitate to reach out—I would love to hear from you!
        </p>
        
        <h2>About My Interest</h2>
        <p>
            I explored many interests and tried many different behaviors when I was growing up.
            There's no shortage of these that aren't interesting or enjoyable. But also found 
            many things that interested me. One of the things I'm most interested in is playing 
            badminton. I started playing badminton in high school and immediately fell in love 
            with the sport. The speed, agility, and strategy involved make every game exciting 
            and challenging.
        </p>

        <p>
            For me, badminton is not just a game—it's a way to stay active, relieve stress,  
            and improve my reflexes. Whether I’m practicing or playing a friendly  
            match with friends, I always find joy in the game.
